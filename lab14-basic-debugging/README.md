# 🧪 Lab 14: Basic Debugging Techniques

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand why debugging is required in Python programs
- Learn to use print statements for debugging
- Get introduced to Python Debugger (pdb)
- Step through code execution to identify errors

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of functions and loops
- Familiarity with running Python scripts

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Debugging Using Print Statements
Track variable values during execution.

### 🔹 Task 2: Using Python Debugger (pdb)
Pause execution and inspect variables interactively.

### 🔹 Task 3: Stepping Through Code
Use pdb commands to move line by line and identify runtime errors.

## ✅ Conclusion
Debugging is a critical skill for developers.
Print debugging is quick for small scripts, while `pdb`
provides powerful control for inspecting complex program behavior.
