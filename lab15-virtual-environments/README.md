# 🧪 Lab 15: Virtual Environments (venv)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what Python virtual environments are
- Learn how to create, activate, and deactivate virtual environments
- Install Python packages inside an isolated environment
- Prevent dependency conflicts between projects

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.3+ installed
- Basic Linux command-line knowledge
- Internet access for package installation

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Use Python’s built-in venv module to create an isolated environment.

### 🔹 Task 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment so Python and pip point to isolated binaries.

### 🔹 Task 3: Install Packages
Install Python packages inside the virtual environment.

### 🔹 Task 4: Deactivate the Environment
Return to the system-wide Python installation.

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Virtual environments reduce the risk of dependency conflicts and supply-chain issues by isolating project dependencies.
They are widely used in secure development pipelines and CI/CD workflows.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Virtual environments are essential for professional Python development.
They ensure clean dependency management, reproducibility, and safer deployments across different projects.
