# 🧪 Lab 31: Logging with Python’s logging Module 📝

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the importance of logging in applications
- Learn how to use Python’s built-in logging module
- Configure logging levels and formats
- Track application execution and errors professionally

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Python 3.x installed
- Familiarity with running Python scripts

---

## 📖 Introduction
Logging is a critical part of professional software development.
Unlike print statements, logging provides:
- Severity levels
- Timestamped records
- Structured and configurable output

Python’s built-in `logging` module is widely used in production systems for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.
In this lab, logging is configured and used to record application behavior and errors.
