# 🧪 Lab 29: Basic SQLite Usage 🗄️

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what SQLite is and where it is used
- Learn how to connect to an SQLite database using Python
- Create database tables and insert records
- Query stored data and display results

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Python 3.x installed
- Familiarity with basic SQL concepts (helpful but not mandatory)

---

## 📖 Introduction
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, embedded database engine.
It is widely used for local storage, testing environments, configuration storage, and small applications.

Python provides built-in SQLite support via the `sqlite3` module, allowing developers to integrate databases without installing additional software.
In this lab, an **in-memory SQLite database** is used to demonstrate core database operations.
