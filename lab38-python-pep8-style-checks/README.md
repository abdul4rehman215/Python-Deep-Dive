# 🧪 Lab 38: Python Style & PEP 8 Checks

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Python coding standards defined by PEP 8
- Learn how to detect style violations using flake8
- Practice automatic code formatting using black and autopep8
- Improve code readability, consistency, and maintainability

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- pip installed
- Basic understanding of Python scripts

---

## 📖 Introduction
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code.
Following PEP 8 helps developers write:
- Clean code
- Readable code
- Consistent code across teams

To enforce these standards, Python provides powerful tools such as:
- flake8 → style checking
- black → opinionated formatter
- autopep8 → flexible formatter

This lab demonstrates detecting and fixing Python style issues using these tools.
