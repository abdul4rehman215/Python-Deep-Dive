# 🧪 Lab 33: Simple Scripting for File Management

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand basic file management using Python
- List files inside a directory programmatically
- Copy files from one directory to another
- Rename files automatically using Python scripts
- Learn how Python scripting automates system tasks

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Familiarity with Linux terminal commands

---

## 📖 Introduction
File management is a common task in system administration, DevOps, and automation.
Python provides built-in modules like `os` and `shutil` that allow scripts to:
- Interact with directories
- Copy and rename files
- Automate repetitive filesystem tasks

This lab demonstrates a simple yet practical file management script.

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Prepare Test Files and Directories
- Create source and destination folders
- Add sample files

### 🔹 Task 2: List Files Using Python
- Use `os.listdir()` to read directory contents

### 🔹 Task 3: Copy Files Programmatically
- Use `shutil.copy()` to back up files

### 🔹 Task 4: Rename Files Automatically
- Append `_backup` to filenames during copy
