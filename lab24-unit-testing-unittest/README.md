# 🧪 Lab 24: Intro to Unit Testing with unittest 🧪

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of unit testing in Python
- Learn how to use Python’s built-in `unittest` framework
- Write basic test cases to validate function behavior
- Execute tests and interpret test results

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Python functions
- Python 3.x installed

---

## 📖 Introduction
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units of code are tested to ensure correctness.
Python provides the built-in `unittest` framework, which allows developers to:
- Define test cases
- Group tests logically
- Run tests automatically
This lab demonstrates writing and running a simple unit test for a Python function.

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Create a Function to Test
- Define a simple mathematical function
- Use it as the test subject

### 🔹 Task 2: Write a Unit Test
- Create a test class using `unittest.TestCase`
- Validate function output using assertions

### 🔹 Task 3: Run Tests
- Execute tests using unittest discovery
- Interpret test output

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Purpose of unit testing
- Structure of `unittest.TestCase`
- Writing test methods
- Assertions and test validation
- Test discovery and execution

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab introduced the basics of unit testing using Python’s `unittest` framework.
By writing and running a simple test, you learned how automated testing helps catch bugs early and improves software reliability.
Unit testing is a critical practice in professional software development and DevOps workflows.
