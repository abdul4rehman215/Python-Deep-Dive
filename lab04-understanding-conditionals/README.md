# 🧪 Lab 04: Understanding Conditionals (if, elif, else)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement conditional logic using if, elif, and else
- Handle multiple conditions safely and correctly
- Control program flow based on user input
- Apply conditionals to real-world classification problems

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Understanding of variables and data types
- Basic terminal usage

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Number Classification
Classify a user-entered number as positive, negative, or zero.

### 🔹 Task 2: Grading System
Use multiple elif conditions to assign grades based on score ranges.
