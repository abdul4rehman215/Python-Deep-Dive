# 🧪 Lab 39: Final Mini-Project – Building a CLI Data Processor

## 🎯 Objectives
- Fetch JSON data from an API using requests
- Validate and parse JSON responses
- Save structured JSON data to a file
- Implement CLI arguments using argparse
- Integrate logging for execution tracking
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- Build a real-world CLI data processing tool

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of:
  - Command-line interfaces
  - JSON data
  - Python scripting
- Internet connectivity

---

## 📖 Introduction
Modern Python tools often operate as CLI utilities that:
- Fetch data from APIs
- Process structured formats like JSON
- Log execution details
- Handle failures gracefully

This lab combines multiple Python concepts into a single real-world
CLI data ingestion and processing tool.

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Environment Setup
- Install required libraries
- Create project script

### 🔹 Task 2: Fetch Data from API
- Perform HTTP GET request
- Validate response and handle errors

### 🔹 Task 3: Save JSON Data
- Write structured JSON to a file

### 🔹 Task 4: CLI Argument Parsing
- Accept API URL and output file path as arguments

### 🔹 Task 5: Logging & Error Handling
- Track execution progress
- Log failures instead of crashing
