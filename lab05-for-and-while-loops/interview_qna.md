# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 05: For & While Loops

1. What is a loop in Python?
   - A loop repeatedly executes code until a condition is met.

2. What are the two main loop types in Python?
   - for loop and while loop.

3. When should a for loop be used?
   - When the number of iterations is known in advance.

4. What does range(1, 6) produce?
   - Numbers from 1 to 5.

5. When is a while loop preferred?
   - When the number of iterations depends on a condition.

6. What risk exists with while loops?
   - Infinite loops if the condition never becomes False.

7. How was the loop variable updated in the while loop?
   - By incrementing it on each iteration.

8. What controls loop termination?
   - The loop condition.

9. Where are loops commonly used?
   - Automation, data processing, and scripting.

10. Why are loops critical in real-world programs?
    - They reduce repetition and improve efficiency.
