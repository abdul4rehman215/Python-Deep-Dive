# 🧪 Lab 05: For & While Loops

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how for and while loops work in Python
- Learn when to use for loops vs while loops
- Control loop execution using conditions and counters
- Apply loops to automate repetitive tasks

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Understanding of variables and basic syntax
- Terminal access

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: For Loop Example
Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

### 🔹 Task 2: While Loop Example
Use a while loop to sum numbers until the total exceeds 20.

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how loops automate repetitive logic in Python.
For loops are ideal when iteration count is known, while while loops are best for condition-based execution.
Loops are foundational for scripting, automation, and data processing.
