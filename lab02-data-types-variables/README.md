# 🧪 Lab 02: Data Types & Variables

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of variables in Python
- Learn common Python data types
- Explore implicit and explicit type casting
- Apply data type conversion in real-world scenarios

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic terminal usage
- Basic programming awareness

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Creating Variables & Checking Types
Variables of different data types were created and inspected using `type()`.

### 🔹 Task 2: Implicit vs Explicit Type Casting
Python’s automatic type conversion and manual casting were demonstrated.

### 🔹 Task 3: Case Study – Customer Data Intake
A realistic scenario showing how string inputs are converted into usable data types.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how Python dynamically handles data types, how type casting works, and why explicit conversion is critical in real-world applications where user input is commonly string-based.
