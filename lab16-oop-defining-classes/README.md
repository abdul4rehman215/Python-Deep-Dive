# 🧪 Lab 16: OOP – Defining Classes

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Learn how to define a class in Python
- Differentiate between instance attributes and class attributes
- Create objects and invoke class methods

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of variables and functions
- Familiarity with running Python scripts
