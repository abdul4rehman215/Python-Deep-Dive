# 🧪 Lab 07: Tuples & Sets

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand tuples as immutable data structures
- Learn how sets store unique values
- Observe differences between lists, tuples, and sets
- Apply tuples and sets in practical scenarios

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of lists and variables
- Terminal access

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Tuples
- Create a tuple
- Attempt modification to observe immutability

### 🔹 Task 2: Sets
- Create a set
- Add duplicate values and observe behavior

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated the use of tuples for fixed, immutable data and sets for enforcing uniqueness.
Understanding when to use these structures improves data integrity and program reliability.
