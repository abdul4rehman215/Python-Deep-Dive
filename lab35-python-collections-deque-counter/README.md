# 🧪 Lab 35: Using collections (deque, Counter)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the purpose of Python’s collections module
- Learn how to use deque for efficient queue operations
- Learn how to use Counter for frequency counting
- Compare collections data structures with built-in lists and dictionaries

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of lists and dictionaries
- Familiarity with Python scripts and terminal usage

---

## 📖 Introduction
Python’s `collections` module provides specialized container data types that improve
performance, readability, and expressiveness of code.

In this lab, two important structures are explored:
- **deque** → Efficient double-ended queue
- **Counter** → Simple and powerful frequency counter

These structures are commonly used in:
- Task scheduling
- Log analysis
- Security monitoring
- Data preprocessing

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Using deque
- Append and remove elements from both ends
- Observe efficient queue-like behavior

### 🔹 Task 2: Using Counter
- Count occurrences of elements in a list
- Identify most common elements

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- deque operations: append, appendleft, pop, popleft
- Counter for frequency analysis
- Performance benefits over lists and dicts
- Real-world use cases in automation and analytics

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how Python’s collections module simplifies and optimizes
common programming tasks. Using deque and Counter leads to cleaner, faster,
and more maintainable code, especially in real-world automation and data analysis scenarios.
