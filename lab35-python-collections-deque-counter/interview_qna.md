1. **What is the collections module in Python?**  
   It provides specialized container data types that extend built-in structures.

2. **What is deque?**

   append() and appendleft().

5. **Which methods remove elements from a deque?**  
   pop() and popleft().

6. **What is Counter used for?**  
   Counting occurrences of hashable objects.

7. **How does Counter simplify counting?**  
   It avoids manual dictionary initialization and increment logic.

8. **What does most_common() do?**  
   Returns the most frequent elements and their counts.

9. **Give a real-world use case of Counter.**  
   Log analysis or frequency analysis of events.

10. **Why are collections useful in production code?**  
    They improve performance, clarity, and maintainability.
