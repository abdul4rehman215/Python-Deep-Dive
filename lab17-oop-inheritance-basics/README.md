# 🧪 Lab 17: OOP – Inheritance Basics

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming
- Create a subclass from a parent class
- Reuse and extend existing class functionality
- Override methods using super()

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of classes and objects
- Familiarity with methods and constructors

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Create a Parent Class
Define a base class containing common attributes and methods.

### 🔹 Task 2: Create a Child Class
Extend the parent class using inheritance.

### 🔹 Task 3: Override Methods
Enhance parent class behavior in the subclass using method overriding.

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Inheritance supports secure software design by promoting code reuse,
reducing duplication, and allowing security controls to be enforced
centrally in base classes.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Inheritance enables scalable and maintainable code by allowing new
functionality to build on existing classes without rewriting logic.
It is a cornerstone of professional object-oriented Python development.
