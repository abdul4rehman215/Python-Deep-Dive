# 🧪 Lab 18: Basic Recursion Example

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of recursion in Python
- Learn how recursive functions work
- Implement a recursive factorial function
- Compare recursion with iteration
- Understand recursion limitations

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic knowledge of functions
- Understanding of loops and conditionals

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Understand Recursion
Learn how a function can call itself to solve smaller sub-problems.

### 🔹 Task 2: Implement Recursive Factorial
Write a recursive function to calculate factorial.

### 🔹 Task 3: Compare Recursion and Iteration
Implement factorial using a loop and compare results.

### 🔹 Task 4: Explore Tail Recursion
Understand tail recursion behavior in Python.

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Recursive functions must be carefully controlled.
Unbounded recursion can lead to stack overflow, denial-of-service risks,
and resource exhaustion in real-world applications.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful programming technique but must be used wisely.
Understanding base cases and recursion depth is critical for writing
safe, efficient, and reliable Python programs.
