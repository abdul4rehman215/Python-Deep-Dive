# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 18: Basic Recursion Example

1. What is recursion?
   - A programming technique where a function calls itself.

2. What are the two essential parts of recursion?
   - A base case and a recursive case.

3. What happens if a base case is missing?
   - Infinite recursion leading to stack overflow.

4. Why is factorial a common recursion example?
   - It naturally breaks into smaller sub-problems.

5. How does recursion differ from iteration?
   - Recursion uses function calls; iteration uses loops.

6. Which is more memory efficient in Python?
   - Iteration is more memory efficient.

7. What is tail recursion?
   - A recursion where the recursive call is the last operation.

8. Does Python optimize tail recursion?
   - No, Python does not support tail-call optimization.

9. When should recursion be avoided?
   - With large inputs or deep recursion depth.

10. Where is recursion used in real-world systems?
    - Tree traversal, parsing, algorithms, and data structures.
