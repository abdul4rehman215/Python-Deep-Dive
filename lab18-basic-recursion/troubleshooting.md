# 🛠 Troubleshooting – Lab 18

### Issue: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
**Cause:** Too many recursive calls  
**Fix:** Add proper base case or use iteration

---

### Issue: Program becomes slow
**Cause:** Excessive recursive calls  
**Fix:** Use iterative approach or memoization

---

### Issue: Stack overflow risk
**Cause:** Deep recursion with large inputs  
**Fix:** Limit recursion depth or rewrite logic using loops
