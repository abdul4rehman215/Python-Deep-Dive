# 🧪 Lab 19: Using Lambda & Higher-Order Functions

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand lambda (anonymous) functions in Python
- Learn how higher-order functions work
- Use map(), filter(), and reduce() effectively
- Write concise and readable functional-style code

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of lists
- Familiarity with functions

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Create a List of Numbers
Prepare input data for functional operations.

### 🔹 Task 2: Use map() with Lambda
Transform each element in a list.

### 🔹 Task 3: Use filter() with Lambda
Select elements based on a condition.

### 🔹 Task 4: Use reduce() with Lambda
Aggregate list values into a single result.

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Functional-style programming reduces mutable state,
which helps minimize logic bugs and unintended side effects—
an important consideration in secure and reliable codebases.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Lambda functions combined with higher-order functions
enable expressive, concise, and efficient data processing.
They are widely used in real-world Python applications,
especially in analytics, automation, and backend systems.
