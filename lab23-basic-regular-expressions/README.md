# 🧪 Lab 23: Basic Regular Expressions (Regex) 🔍

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of regular expressions (regex)
- Learn how to use Python’s built-in `re` module
- Find, match, and replace patterns in strings
- Use regex groups and named groups for structured extraction

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with strings and string operations
- Python 3.x installed

---

## 📖 Introduction
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to search, extract, validate, and manipulate text.
Python provides the `re` module to work with regex efficiently.
In this lab, common regex operations such as matching digits, replacing values, and extracting structured data are demonstrated.

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Import the re Module
- Create a Python script
- Import the `re` module

### 🔹 Task 2: Compile and Use Regex Patterns
- Match digits using special characters
- Extract multiple matches using `findall()`

### 🔹 Task 3: Replace Text Using Regex
- Replace numeric values with placeholders

### 🔹 Task 4: Use Regex Groups
- Capture structured patterns like dates
- Use named groups for clarity

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Regex syntax (`\d`, `+`, `{}`, groups)
- `re.compile()` for reusable patterns
- `findall()` vs `finditer()`
- Text replacement with `sub()`

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab introduced the basics of regular expressions in Python.
You learned how to search, extract, replace, and structure text data using regex.
These skills are essential for log analysis, data validation, parsing, and automation tasks.
