# 🧪 Lab 36: BFS / DFS Implementation (Data Structures)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand graph traversal concepts
- Learn Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Learn Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Implement BFS and DFS using Python
- Compare BFS and DFS traversal behavior

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of lists, dictionaries, and functions
- Familiarity with basic graph concepts
- Python 3.x installed

## 📖 Introduction
Graph traversal algorithms are core concepts in computer science.
They are widely used in:
- Networking
- Cybersecurity
- Routing algorithms
- Artificial intelligence
- System design

In this lab, a graph is represented using an adjacency list, and both
BFS and DFS traversal techniques are implemented from scratch.
