# 🧪 Lab 25: Decorators – Basic Usage 🎯

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of decorators in Python
- Learn how decorators modify function behavior
- Implement a basic decorator using function wrapping
- Use decorators to add reusable logic like logging

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Python functions
- Python 3.x installed

---

## 📖 Introduction
Decorators are a powerful Python feature that allows you to extend or modify the behavior of functions without changing their original code.
They are commonly used for logging, authentication, caching, performance measurement, and access control.
This lab demonstrates how a simple decorator works internally and how it is applied using the `@decorator` syntax.

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Understand Decorator Concept
- A decorator is a function that takes another function as input
- It returns a new function with enhanced behavior

### 🔹 Task 2: Write a Basic Decorator
- Create a decorator that prints messages before and after function execution

### 🔹 Task 3: Apply the Decorator
- Use the `@decorator_name` syntax
- Call the decorated function and observe behavior changes

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Higher-order functions
- Function wrapping
- Decorator syntax (`@`)
- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Separation of concerns

---

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, you learned how Python decorators work and how they enhance function behavior transparently.
Decorators help keep code clean, reusable, and modular by separating common logic from business logic.
They are widely used in frameworks, automation tools, and production-grade Python applications.
